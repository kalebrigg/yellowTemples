# Yellow Temple Project

## Overview 
The Family Tree at familysearch.org provides the primary way in which information is gathered to provide temple ordinances to the ancestors and relatives of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Family Tree requires a set of basic information about an individual in order for their temple work to be complete. This information includes a name and the date and place of one life event (birth, marriage, or death). If any of this information is missing the temple tab for the individual will display a "yellow temple" and indicate that more information is required for the ordinance to be completed. Once that required information is entered on the Family Tree then the yellow temple will turn into a green temple.

There are 320 million individuals on the Family Tree that have at least one yellow temple. This project has been designed to address these yellow temples in FamilySearch's database and convert them to green temples. The information needed to convert these database entries into green temples is available through data scraping
but has been unintentionally neglected by users of Family Search. 

Here is an example of a database person entry that is classified as a yellow temple. The red circle shows this persons birthdate but the birth place is missing.

However, the missing information to convert this user profile to a green temple can be found here in a US Census record that has already been atttached to the profile. This persons birthplace is shown with a red underline as Delaware, United States.
